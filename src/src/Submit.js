        <p class="subtitle is-5">MusMe opens the doors to composers.</p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5">Our team is very open-minded and will listen to your suggestions and advice.</p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5">We don’t have any restrictions regarding the style or genre of music you create, but please keep in mind that we only accept high quality material, both in terms of musical structure and recording/production.</p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5">Audio File should be cleanly recorded and professionally prepared, in the highest quality possible. The music/audio file should have an aesthetic value and should be useful for media purposes. All of the submitted files are reviewed by our team before appearing on the marketplace. The review procedure takes a maximum of 12 days (usually within a week).</p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5">Due to the large number of submissions to the library, all new accounts are allowed to submit up to three music/audio files and wait for the review process to pass successfully before submitting more files. This is a one-time procedure that will be easy to pass for most of the authors and will help us to maintain the highest quality across the TwinsMusic Enterprises marketplace.</p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5"><b>File Size</b><br></br>
        Files should be no larger than 100MB and must be sent as downloadable files to twinsmusicny@yahoo.com via WeTransfer.</p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5"><b>File Format</b><br></br>
        All files should be high-quality WAV files (16 Bit, 44.1 kHz).</p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5">Please check your files before uploading to make sure they are high-quality and broadcast-ready. After uploading, your item is inspected and checked by our review team to ensure that it is suitable for the marketplace.</p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5"><b>Ownership</b><br></br>
        You must be the copyright-owner for any audio you make available for licensing.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5">
        Ownership must be 100% in order to be eligible for the TwinsMusic Enterprises catalog.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5"><b>Legal Issues</b><br></br>
        As an author you have the responsibility to only sell things that belong to you. By selling an item, you are making an agreement not only with TwinsMusic Enterprises but with anyone who buys your item that you own full copyright to that item, and have appropriately licensed any content that it makes use of.</p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5">Transactions are between you and the purchaser. If you are doing something wrong (e.g. breaching copyright), you are responsible and liable. TwinsMusic Enterprises has the right to remove the item or permanently ban the author if there are multiple instances of copyright issues.</p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5"><b>Licenses</b><br></br>
        When you sell an item on TwinsMusic Enterprises you are granting a buyer a license to use the item. There are two types of licenses:
        <ul>
          <li>MusMe Moods Library sold in an annual subscription.</li>
          <li>A Standard License which is sold on a per item basis.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5"><b>Pricing</b><br></br>
        The cost of each item is decided by our team during the review by complexity, duration and quality. You can suggest the price during the upload (by adding a note for reviewer) but it’s not guaranteed that the audio file will be sold at your suggested price.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5"><b>Payment Rate</b><br></br>
        Non-exclusive authors will receive the following payment percentages for their work:
        <ul>
          <li>50% of the revenue sold for single song licensing.</li>
          <li>50% of the revenue we collect from our MusMe Moods Library, based on the number of downloads for an author’s song.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5"><b>Withdrawals</b><br></br>
        You can request a withdrawal of earnings from your account once you have reached a threshold of $50 or more.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5">
        We require you to <a class="custom-link" href="https://luckstock.com/users/identity-tax/">submit a copy of Passport/ID-card and W-9/W-8BEN form</a> before we accept a withdrawal request. It’s a one-time procedure.

        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5">
